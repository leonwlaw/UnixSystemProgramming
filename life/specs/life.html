  <h1>Homework 1: Basic C</h1>
  <h2>Focus</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>C Basics</li>
    <li>Command line arguments</li>
    <li>Dynamic memory allocation</li>
  </ul>
  <h2>Details</h2>
  <p>
    We are going to implment Conway's well known Game of Life.  You
    can find more than you need to know at,
    e.g., <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway's_Game_of_Life">the
    Wikipedia entry</a>.  But all you really need is
    the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway's_Game_of_Life#Rules">rules</a>.
    For convenience, I will repeat them here:
    <ul>
      <li>Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbours dies.
      <li>Any live cell with two or three live neighbours lives on to the next generation.
      <li>Any live cell with more than three live neighbours dies.
      <li>Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbours becomes a live cell.
    </ul>
  <p>
    So what other details are there?
    <ul>
      <li>
        Our program will read in a file depicting an initial
        configuration for the world.  By default, the file's name will
        be "life.txt".  A different file name may be specified by the
        user on the command line.
      <li>
        The program will generate and display a "world" based on the
        input file.  The actual number of rows and columns in the
        world may be different than what is in the file.  Default
        values for both the number of rows and the number of columns
        will be 10.  Again, different values can be provided on the
        command line.

        If there are fewer lines in the file or lines are shorter
        than expected, the missing "cells" will be assumed to be
        dead.
      </li>
      <li>
        After displaying the initial state, the program will proceed
        to calculate some number of additional generations, displaying
        each in turn.  The number of generations will be 10 by
        default, but a different value may be provided on the command
        line.
      <li>
        The program is run from the command line as follows:
        <blockquote>
          <code>life rows columns filename generations</code>
        </blockquote>
        Note that all values are optional, so the program might be run as:
        <ul>
          <li><code>life</code>
          <li><code>life rows columns</code>
          <li><code>life rows columns filename</code>
          <li><code>life rows columns filename generations</code>
        </ul>
        where rows, columns and generations are all numbers for the
        specified values to override the defaulst and filename is similarly the
        name of a file to use instead of life.txt.
      <li>
        An example input file is this <a href="life.txt">life.txt</a>
        and the corresponding output that would display on the
        console, assuming we used the defaults, is in the file
        <a href="output.txt">output.txt</a>.
    </ul>
  </p>
  <h2>General Homework Requirements</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Provide <em>reasonable</em> comments.
    <li>Use <em>good</em> names for everything (functions, variables, etc.)
    <li>Make <em>good</em> use of functions.
    <li>
      Be sure to <em>explicitly</em> free up any resources that you
      allocate.
    <li>Do not use globals for anything except constants.
    <li>If you are not sure what any of the above means, ask in class.
  </ul>
  <h2>Additional Requirements</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Do <em>not</em> use local arrays to represent the world.  Use
      the heap instead.
  </ul>
  <h2>Suggestion</h2>
  <p>
  It will make your life easier if your program creates an extra row
  at the top and bottom and an extra column to the left and the right,
  with all of the extra cells marked as dead.  This hack can save you
  having to worry about edges or corners.
  </p>

  <h2>Submit</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Submit your files in a zip file called hw01.zip
    <li>Include a single C source file with your solution.
    <li>Include a make file
    <li>
      If there is anything we should know about your code (e.g. it
      doesn't work...), include a README file.  Or just include one if
      you like writing something about your program.
  </ul>
  <h2>Questions?</h2>
  <p>
    If you have any questions about the spec, please ask during class,
    come by the office or post on the discussion board.
