Chat
=======================

Chat client:
  client [--debug] [interface] port username # client mode

Chat server:
  server [--debug] [interface] port

Optionally, the client may also be used in server mode, only for 1:1 chats:
  chat [--debug] --server [interface] port username

 * Interface defaults to any interface (INADDR_ANY) if not specified.
 * --debug and --server can be in any order.

Changes to client (from v1):
 * Client will print out a newline after printing out a received message.
   This is because the chat server will send a whitespace-stripped version
   of the string clients send to it, which includes the trailing '\n'
   character.
