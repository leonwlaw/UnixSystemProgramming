<h2>2-Way Chat</h2>
<h3>Focus</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Networking</li>
  <li>Multi-plexing</li>
</ul>
<h3>Spec</h3>
<p>Application: Allow two users to "chat"</p>

<ul>
  <li>We need a "server" that will sit there waiting for a client to
  connect.</li>
  <li>After receiving a connection, both client and server will act alike.</li>
  <li>Each will take whatever the user at their end types in and send
  it, together with the user's name to the other process.</li>
  <li>They will also take whatever they other process sends over the
  network connection and display it to their user.  Each transmission
  from one party to the other includes the sender's name.  The
  receiver does not have to remember that name.</li>
  <li>There "problem", aside from the usual setting up programs to act
    as TCP/IP client and server, is <em>how does a process get input
    from two sources at a time</em>?</li>
  <li>One could constantly poll, with the downsides of wasted cpu
  usage and possibly additional delay in recognizing input due to
  sleeping.</li>
  <li>One could assign a thread or even a process to the the task of
  reading from each file descriptor.</li>
  <li>In this assignment you will use the Unix function select.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Interface</h3>
<ul>
  <li>While it would be nice to have a pretty GUI for this program, we
    will do without one.  (If we get to covering the Curses library it
    might be nice to add a GUI.)</li>
  <li>Instead we will simply have the user type to the application at the
    shell and similarly see the output displayed to the shell.</li>
  <li>To start either the client or the server, you will want to provide
    a name for the user on the command line.</li>
  <li>The server should also accept a port number at the command line,
    so that we can run it flexibly using whatever port number is
    convenient.</li>
  <li>The client will need to provide both the IP address of the server
    together with the port number that the server is listening on.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Turn in:</h3>
  <p>Submit your solution on Blackboard as a <em>compressed</em> tar
  file. It should include:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>A makefile</li>
    <li>The source file(s).  It is possible to combine both client and
    server in one program.  Feel free to do so if you like or write
    them as two separate programs.  I have no preference.</li>
    <li>README. Make sure it is clear how to run your program.  Also,
      if there is anything I should know about, such as anything that
      doesn't work, explain it here.</li>
  </ul>
