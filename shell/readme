What works:
 - redirecting a file to stdin
 - redirecting stdout to a file
 - redirecting multiple files to stdin (last file will be used)
 - redirecting stdout to multiple files directly from command line (last file will be used)

What doesn't work:
 - redirecting stdout to multiple files, when input is redirected into supershell (no files get output, period)

Misc stuff that wasn't in the spec:
 - supershell can take redirected input! (checks if fgets returns anything)
 - Automated(-ish) testing via 'make test'
